### Calculus
Not only how steeply a line slopes, but indeed, how steeply any curve slopes at any given time.

A tangent line skims across the curve, hitting it once in the indicated location; 
however, a secant line does not skim at all. It cuts right through a function, usually intersecting it in multiple spots.

f`(5) 
Means the slope of the tagent line at 5. Or you can see this as the rate of change
of y with respect to x of our function f.

Having a positive slope, for example delta y / delta x = 2 / 1 = 2 means that for 
every set in the x direction we go up two in the y direction.
But if we have -2 that would mean that for every set in the x direction we would 
go down 2 in the y direction.

(4, 4,5)
(6, 0,74)
To estimate, draw a tangent line and then take a point on the tangent line and make
a triangle (dt/dx). 

Delta = change

slope = delta y / delta x

When we have a line we take the change in x and the the change in y. This looks like a triangle
of half a rectangle:
+--------+
|       /|
|     /  |  y
|   /    |
| /      |
/        |
----------
    x
Lets say that x = 2 and y = 3, this would give us 3/2 = 1.5.
 y
 -- = 1.5         y = 1.5 * 2 = y = 3 
 2
 
 3
 -- = 1.5   3 = 1.5 * x  3 / 1.5 = 2
 x                       

Now if you take any two point on the same line you'll get the same slope regardless of the
distance between the points.


y = mx + b




### Derivative
Take the function f(x) = x^2.
x | y = x^2
------------
1 | x^2 = 1
3 | x^3 = 9

We can take the chage in y which is 9 - 1 divided by the change in x which is 3 - 1:

  9 - 1   8    
  ----- = -- = 4
  3 - 1   2    

So that is our average rate of change of that interval and is the secant line between the points.

If you have a constant for x then that means that y will have the same value regardless of
what value of x you give it. So it will not have a slope, the slope will be zero.
